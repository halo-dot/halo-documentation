# Refunds

## Void

Cancels a transaction before it has been finalized or settled. No money is moved. Typically used within the same day or session.<br/>
Use when: The transaction was made in error and needs to be stopped before processing.

## Reversal

Undoes a transaction before settlement but after authorization. The funds are returned to the cardholder as if the transaction never happened.<br/>
Use when: The transaction was authorized, but something failed before settlement (e.g. a system error or a customer changes their mind immediately).

## Refund
Returns money after a transaction has been settled. The funds are sent back to the cardholder’s account. <br/>
Use when: A customer returns a product or service after the transaction has gone through.

## Prevention on transaction

Transaction are processed by the SDK to the payment processor and to the bank.<br/>
If either of those channel failed the transaction would be voided and no payment would occur.<br/>
The client can then again try the transaction again.
