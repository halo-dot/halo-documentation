#### Halo.SDK Integration Guide

Welcome to the Halo.SDK integration guide! Follow these steps to quickly integrate the Halo.SDK into your Android application.

##### Getting Started

To start integrating the Halo.SDK into your app, you will need to add it as a dependency in your project.

Both debug and release versions of the SDK are available. The release version is suitable for production use. The debug version is intended for development and testing purposes; it has full logging enabled and allows a debugger to be attached to the app.

The Halo.SDK is hosted in a Maven repository, and stored in an S3 bucket in a Halo AWS account.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a>:** You will need Android Studio installed on your system to run the test app.
