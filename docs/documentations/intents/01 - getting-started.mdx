# Getting Started with Intents

## 1. Intent Integration Methods

The Halo.Go application currently provides different mechanisms to integrate and try our payment solution depending on your use case. The different methods are:

1. Android Intents
2. Deeplinking

Have a look at the image below as a guideline:

## 2. Intent Authorization

1. To get started register on the <a href="https://go.merchantportal.prod.haloplus.io/" target="_blank">Merchant Portal</a> and retrieve your `Merchant ID` and `API Key`.

_**Get Merchant ID**_

The `Merchant ID` can easily be found on the <a href="https://go.merchantportal.prod.haloplus.io/" target="_blank">Merchant Portal</a>. \
From the  Portal, navigate to Users. \
There, you will see your unique `Merchant ID`.&#x20;

_**Get API Key**_

In the user table generate your `API Key`.

> Note the warning pop-up when generating an `API Key`.

![API Key Warning](/img/caution.png)

Since an `API Key`is a sensitive value, it is stored as an encrypted value in our database and only presented in clear text once during the initial retrieval. It is the responsibility of the user to keep their `API Key` safe.

The combination of the MerchantID and the API-Key will be used to make API request to the backend see <a href="https://halo-dot-developer-docs.gitbook.io/halo-dot/readme/transaction-app2app-integration-guide#intent-transaction" target="_blank">Intent Transaction</a> for more details.

## 3. Intent Use Cases

With Halo Dot the exact same technology can be used for different use cases. However, the integration is slightly different to allow us to distinguish the use cases. The use cases and their specific integration guides are:

* [Transactions / Payments Acceptance](/docs/documentations/intents/transaction-app2app-integration-guide)
* [TT3 / Debicheck](/docs/documentations/intents/tt3-app2app-integration-guide)
