**Introduction**\
This section includes requirements for Tap on Phone and other software point-of-sale (SoftPOS) solutions, in conjunction with the core Mastercard® marks.

Tap on Phone is an acceptance solution that allows merchants to accept payments from any contactless card, mobile wallet, or non-digital wearable device, using the merchant’s own eligible NFC-enabled device.

\
The use of branding for Tap on Phone and other SoftPOS solutions must be applied when:

* A Tap on Phone or SoftPOS solution is created accepting the Mastercard network\

* A device has a Tap on Phone or SoftPOS solution installed accepting the Mastercard network

**Pre-Payment Acceptance Requirements**\
Branding within Tap on Phone or SoftPOS solution prior to payment acceptance on merchant’s device screen:

* Must display Contactless symbol
* Must display Mastercard and and other network acceptance marks, in accordance with the applicable network requirements. For Mastercard display and parity requirements in the digital environment, see **Signaling digital payment acceptance** in [Use in digital payments](https://www.mastercard.com/brandcenter/en-ca/brand-requirements/mastercard/digital-payments).
